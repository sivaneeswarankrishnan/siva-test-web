Hi,

This is my react + typescript app about the web test you provided.

I have done a form t submit and below the form will be shown the list I submit of my preference. As you asked I have also provide delete button for each list to delete if we want and when we left the web and comeback all the saved list will be stored using the react function localStorage.

In order to run the react project, pull the code in your local and go to the folder terminal or open using code . to open in Visual Studio Code.
yarn intall or npm install , use which you confortable . Boom you can view that.

Thank you for the opportunity and see you soon.
